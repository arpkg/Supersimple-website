            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that some form of improvement
                took place. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education.
                Many factors influence whether education is successful. Psychological factors include motivation,
                intelligence, and personality. Social factors, like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are
                often linked to discrimination. Further factors include educational technology, teacher quality, and
                parent involvement.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is often divided into types. The most common division is
                between formal, non-formal, and informal education. However, some theorists only distinguish between
                formal and informal education. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework. Such
                frameworks have a chronological and hierarchical order. For instance, the modern schooling system has
                classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from primary school to university. Formal
                education is usually controlled and guided by the government. It is normally compulsory up to a certain
                age</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Types of education are often divided into levels or stages. The most
                influential framework is the International Standard Classification of Education. It is maintained by the
                United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). It covers both formal and
                non-formal education. It distinguishes levels based on the student's age, the duration of learning, and
                the complexity of the discussed content. Further criteria include entry requirements, teacher
                qualifications, and the intended outcome of successful completion. The levels are grouped together into
                early childhood education (level 0), primary education (level 1), secondary education (levels 2-3),
                post-secondary non-tertiary education (level 4), and tertiary education (levels 5-8).</p>
